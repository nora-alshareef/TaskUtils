Certainly. I'll update the README to reflect these important points and the specific implementation details you've provided. Here's the revised README:

# Task Utilities

This library provides utilities for managing recurring tasks with fixed delay with cancellation, fixed rate with cancellation, and scheduling execution patterns. It's designed to offer safe and efficient task scheduling without relying on potentially blocking or unsafe methods.

## Features

- Fixed Delay with Cancellation
- Fixed Rate with Cancellation
- Scheduled Execution

## Important Note

We do not allow fixed delay without cancellation due to potential blocking behavior. All execution patterns include cancellation support to ensure safety and prevent resource locking.

## Getting Started

1. Choose the appropriate execution type for your use case:
   - Fixed Delay with Cancellation
   - Fixed Rate with Cancellation
   - Scheduled Execution

2. Implement your task handler by implementing the `IHandler` interface:

```csharp
public interface IHandler
{ 
    Task ProcessAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}
```

3. Build your task logic inside the `ProcessAsync` method:

```csharp
public class HandlerA : IHandler
{
    private readonly ILogger<IHandler> _logger;

    public HandlerA(ILogger<IHandler> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task ProcessAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Do some work 
        cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        // Another work 
        cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
    }
}
```

4. Configure your workers in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "workers": [
    {
      "HandlerName": "HandlerA",
      "WorkerType": "FixedDelay",
      "IsActive": false,
      "DelayInSeconds": 5,
      "ErrorDelayInSeconds": 20,
      "IterationTimeoutInSeconds": 3
    },
    {
      "HandlerName": "HandlerB",
      "WorkerType": "FixedRate",
      "IsActive": false,
      "RateInSeconds": 3,
      "IterationTimeoutInSeconds": 30
    },
    {
      "HandlerName": "HandlerC",
      "WorkerType": "Scheduled",
      "IsActive": false,
      "RateInSeconds": 3,
      "IterationTimeoutInSeconds": 3600,
      "SpecifiedHours": ["23:12", "23:27:00", "23:27:30"]
    }
  ]
}
```

5. In your `Program.cs`, add the following line to configure and add the worker service:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddWorkerService(
    builder.Configuration,
    new HandlerA(logger),
    new HandlerB(logger),
    new HandlerC(logger)
    // Add more handlers as needed
);
```

## Execution Types

### Fixed Delay with Cancellation

Ensures a consistent delay between the completion of one task and the start of the next, with the ability to cancel long-running tasks.

### Fixed Rate with Cancellation

Attempts to start tasks at a consistent interval, regardless of how long each task takes, with the ability to cancel tasks that exceed a specified timeout.

### Scheduled Execution

Allows tasks to be executed at specific times or intervals, with cancellation support.

## Best Practices

1. Implement cancellation checks at appropriate points in your task logic.
2. For fixed delay and fixed rate, choose appropriate timeout values based on your task's expected duration.
3. For scheduled execution, ensure that your specified times don't conflict with other critical operations.
4. Always handle exceptions within tasks to prevent unexpected termination of the execution loop.

## Configuration Options

- `HandlerName`: The name of your implemented handler.
- `WorkerType`: Choose from "FixedDelay", "FixedRate", or "Scheduled".
- `IsActive`: Set to true to enable the worker.
- `DelayInSeconds`: (For FixedDelay) The delay between task completions.
- `ErrorDelayInSeconds`: (For FixedDelay) The delay after an error occurs.
- `RateInSeconds`: (For FixedRate) The interval between task starts.
- `IterationTimeoutInSeconds`: The maximum allowed duration for a single task execution.
- `SpecifiedHours`: (For Scheduled) An array of specific times to run the task.

## Limitations

- These utilities do not support multi-threading or parallel execution of tasks within a single handler.
- Fixed rate execution may lead to task overlap if a task takes longer than the specified interval.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve these utilities are welcome. Please ensure that any changes maintain the safety and reliability of task execution.
